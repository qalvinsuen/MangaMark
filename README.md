# MangaMark
MangaMark is a Chrome extension which automatically bookmarks the chapter/page of the manga you read on compatible sites.
By clicking on the extension's icon, a list of hyperlinks will appear with each manga's name and chapter.
Each bookmark can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button, checking the box for the corresponding bookmark, then clicking "Delete" again.
There is also a button which takes you to a list of compatible sites which is currently at a total of four, but more compatible sites will be added in the future.
The four sites that are currently supported by MangaMark include:
https://www.mangareader.net/
https://mangahub.io/
https://www.webtoons.com/
https://mangapark.net/
The extension is currently under review to be published in the Chrome Web Store.
